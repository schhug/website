I have lived in Montr\u00e9al my whole life, and French is my first language. After a brief career as a hospital pharmacist, I completed a B.Sc. in physics and computer science at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 2022, where I did research in mathematical physics. Today, my broad research interests are cosmology, dark matter, and astroparticle physics. Lately I have been thinking a lot about finite temperature field theory and its applications in cosmology and astrophysics.</p>"},{"location":"cv/","title":"Curriculum Vitae","text":"<p>Here is my CV as of 2024-10-24.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"outreach/","title":"Outreach","text":"<p>(TBD)</p>"},{"location":"research/","title":"Research","text":""},{"location":"research/#research-interests","title":"Research interests","text":"<p>Dark Matter - I'm interested in searching of the nature of dark matter!

These days I'm especially thinking about what happens with dark matter during and around Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.</p> <p>Finite temperature field theory - I'm interested in finite-temperature effects on particle behavior, and how they can be used as unique probes of dark matter or physics beyond the Standard Model. The radiation-dominated era of our universe is a great environment for such effects!</p>"},{"location":"research/#latest-project","title":"Latest project","text":"<p>The dispersion relation of photons is modified in a medium, for example in a plasma. This is encoded in the photon self-energy, which can be conceptualized as an effective mass that depends on temperature and charge density. Previous work had focused on the self-energy of real (or on-shell) photons. In this project, I computed the photon self-energy for virtual (or off-shell) photons, including analytical approximations for this quantity!</p> <p>Find the paper on the arXiv here!</p>"},{"location":"research/#published-work","title":"Published work","text":"<p>Find it on INSPIRE or arXiv.</p> <p>You'll find that I've worked previously on exactly solvable mathematical physicics models and orthogonal polynomials!</p>"},{"location":"research/#publication-list","title":"Publication list","text":"<p>Here is a list of all my publications in physics so far.</p>"},{"location":"research/#2024","title":"2024","text":"<p>Photon self-energy at all temperatures and densities in all of phase space (submitted to JHEP) [arXiv:2405.18466]</p>"},{"location":"research/#2022","title":"2022","text":"<p>A classical model for perfect transfer and fractional revival based on q-Racah polynomials [arXiv:2110.01042]</p> <p>Analytic \u201cNewton\u2019s cradles\u201d with perfect transfer and fractional revival [arXiv:2108.09386]</p>"},{"location":"research/#masters-thesis","title":"Master's thesis","text":"<p>I completed my M.Sc. in 2024 at McGill University (Montreal, Canada), supervised by Prof. Katelin Schutz and Prof. Oscar Hern\u00e1ndez.
