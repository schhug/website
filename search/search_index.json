I'm based in Montr\u00e9al, and I have lived there my whole life, with French being my first language. After a brief career as a hospital pharmacist, I completed a B.Sc. in physics and computer science at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 2022, where I did research in mathematical physics with Prof. Luc Vinet. I joined Prof. Katelin Schutz's research group at McGill at first as an M.Sc. student in 2022 and now as a Ph.D. student since 2024.</p> <p>Today, my broad research interests are cosmology, dark matter, and astroparticle physics.

For example, the photon in a plasma acquires a new longitudinal polarization mode, as well as an effective mass. These are encoded in what we call the photon self-energy. Previous work had focused on the self-energy of real (or on-shell) photons, i.e. the ones that propagate through arbitrary distances<sup>2</sup>. But the self-energy is also important for virtual (or off-shell) photons, i.e. the ones that are intermediate states in particle physics processes (like scatterings). In this project, I computed the photon self-energy for off-shell photons. This includes analytical approximations for the self energy as a function of temperature and electron density!</p> <p>Find the paper on the arXiv here!</p>"},{"location":"research/#publication-list","title":"Publication list","text":"<p>Here is a list of all my publications in physics.
