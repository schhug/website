# About me

## Bio

I am a Ph.D student in physics and Vanier Scholar working in Prof. Katelin Schutz's research group at McGill University. I'm based in Montréal, and I have lived there my whole life, with French being my first language. After a brief career as a hospital pharmacist, I completed a B.Sc. in physics and computer science at Université de Montréal in 2022, where I did research in mathematical physics with Prof. Luc Vinet. I joined Prof. Katelin Schutz's research group at McGill, at first as an M.Sc. student in 2022 (co-supervised by Prof. Oscar Hernández), and now as a Ph.D. student since 2024.

Today, my broad research interests are cosmology, dark matter, and astroparticle physics. Lately I have been thinking a lot about finite temperature field theory and its applications in cosmology and astrophysics.

## Teaching activities

I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses:

- PHYS320 - Introductory Astrophysics (McGill University, Fall 2024)
- PHY1620 - Ondes et vibrations (Université de Montréal, Winter 2022)
- PHY1901 - Mécanique et physique moderne (Université de Montréal, Fall 2021)
- PHY1902 - Électricité et optique (Université de Montréal, Winter 2021)

I have also supervised Pharm.D. students during clinical internships while I was a pharmacist at CHU Sainte-Justine.
