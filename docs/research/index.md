## Research interests

**Dark Matter** - I'm interested in searching of the nature of dark matter! I'm working on the phenomenology side of things, trying to find signatures or place bounds on dark matter models, or on physics beyond the Standard Model in general. These days I'm thinking a lot about the dark photon as a potential dark sector candidate.

**Cosmology and astrophysics** - I'm interested in cosmology and astrophysics, especially as probes on the nature of dark matter. These days I'm especially thinking about what happens with dark matter during and around Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

**Finite temperature field theory** - I'm interested in finite-temperature effects on particle behavior, and how they can be used as unique probes of dark matter or physics beyond the Standard Model. The radiation-dominated era of our universe is a great environment for such effects!

## Published work

Find it on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2050860) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/scherer_h_1.html).

You'll find that I've worked previously on exactly solvable mathematical physicics models and orthogonal polynomials!

## Latest project

The dispersion relation of photons is modified in a medium, for example in a plasma. This is encoded in the photon self-energy, which can be conceptualized as an effective mass that depends on temperature and charge density. Previous work had focused on the self-energy of real (or on-shell) photons. In this project, I computed the photon self-energy for virtual (or off-shell) photons, including analytical approximations for this quantity!

## Master's thesis

I completed my M.Sc. in 2024 at McGill University (Montreal, Canada), supervised by Prof. Katelin Schutz and Prof. Oscar Hern√°ndez. It is about finite temperature field theory, and more specifically about the photon self-energy (same as my latest project but with more details!). If you're interested, you can find it here:
